We should however, change it so any CPU that supports the payload moves forward, while CPUs not supporting the payload get halted. We could then report to the payload which CPUs have been halted due to extension mismatches. This way the payload can decide what to do (keep the CPUs halted, boot them using a different payload etc.)",

([#&#8203;586](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/586))\n\n### [`v0.15.1`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v0151---2024-11-03)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1)\n\nThis release removes the `borsh` feature introduced in 0.15.0 because it was\nfound to be incorrectly implemented. Users should use the `hashbrown` feature of\nthe `borsh` crate instead which provides the same trait implementations.\n\n### [`v0.15.0`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#-v0150---2024-10-01)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/compare/v0.14.5...v0.15.0)\n\nThis release was *yanked* due to a broken implementation of the `borsh` feature.\n\nThis update contains breaking changes that remove the `raw` API with the hope of\ncentralising on the `HashTable` API in the future. You can follow the discussion\nand progress in [#&#8203;545](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/545) to discuss features you think should be added to this API\nthat were previously only possible on the `raw` API.\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added `borsh` feature with `BorshSerialize` and `BorshDeserialize` impls.

([#&#8203;561](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/561))\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   Changed `hash_set::VacantEntry::insert` to return `OccupiedEntry`. ([#&#8203;495](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/495))\n-   Improved`hash_set::Difference::size_hint` lower-bound. ([#&#8203;530](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/530))\n-   Improved `HashSet::is_disjoint` performance.

([#&#8203;529](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/529))\n-   Changed the default hasher to foldhash. ([#&#8203;563](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/563))\n-   `ahash` feature has been renamed to `default-hasher`. ([#&#8203;533](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/533))\n-   Entry API has been reworked and several methods have been renamed. ([#&#8203;535](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/535))\n-   `Hash{Map,Set}::insert_unique_unchecked` is now unsafe. ([#&#8203;556](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/556))\n-   The signature of `get_many_mut` and related methods was changed. ([#&#8203;562](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/562))\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed typos, stray backticks in docs. ([#&#8203;558](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/558), [#&#8203;560](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/560))\n\n##### Removed\n\n-   Raw entry API is now under `raw-entry` feature, to be eventually removed.

([#&#8203;531](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/531), [#&#8203;546](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/546))\n-   `rykv` feature was removed; this is now provided by the `rykv` crate instead. ([#&#8203;554](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/554))\n-   `HashSet::get_or_insert_owned` was removed in favor of `get_or_insert_with`.

    "body": "Until now, kernel debugging was been limited to structured logging through `log` and while that is great and more than sufficient for release-build logging, for debugging purposes and especially for performance work we need something more sophisticated.\r\n\r\nTo this end #185 introduced the concept time & initial support for monotonic and wall-time clocks into the kernel, so that we can actually measure things. \r\n\r\nThis PR lays the groundwork for more sophisticated debugging by bringing [`tracing`] support to the kernel. [`tracing`] is a standard Rust crate that - in addition to *events* that `log` deals with - knows about *spans* which represent spans of execution between two points in time. Since tracing has been built with asynchronous Rust in mind, spans can also be paused and resumed an arbitrary amount of time (called `entering` and `exiting`) which is convenient for tracking execution time in all kinds of multitasking setups.\r\n[`tracing`] also features a host of convenient macros to emit these spans.\r\n\r\n[`tracing`]: https://crates.io/crates/tracing",

This will attempt to allocate from a hart-local frame cache first before falling back on the globally shared allocator.\r\n- `allocate_contiguous(layout: Layout) -> Option<linked_list::List<Frame>>` - Allocate a number of frames that satisfy the given layouts size and alignment. Both size and alignment must be at least `PAGE_SIZE`. This will attempt to allocate from a hart-local frame cache first before falling back on the globally shared allocator.\r\n- `deallocate_contiguous(linked_list::List<Frame>)` - Deallocate a list of frames. The caller doesn't need to remember the original layout passed to `allocate_contiguous`. Freed frames are currently never returned to the global allocator, instead they will only ever be returned to the hart-local cache.\r\n",

    "title": "feat: VM (finally)",
    "body": "This PR brings all the pieces together implementing a proper virtual memory subsystem. Key components of the new system:\r\n\r\n- `Frame` is a thread-safe reference counted RAII pointer to a `FrameInfo` struct which represents metadata about a frame of physical memory. `Frame`s are handed out the `frame_allocator` and - just like an `Arc` once all instances of `Frame` are dropped, the underlying `FrameInfo` will be marked as free and returned to the `frame_allocator`.\r\n- `FrameList` is a mutable always sorted list of `Frame`s.\r\n- `AddressSpace` is the main type of the subsystem, it represents an address space (kernel or user) and allows manipulating it through various methods. An `AddressSpace` is a sorted list of `AddressSpaceRegion`s implemented using a binary search Weak AVL tree.\r\n- `AddressSpaceRegion` is a contiguous region of virtual memory and associated flags backed by a virtual memory object `Vmo`. A single `Vmo` can be mapped into virtual memory by many `AddressSpaceRegions`.\r\n- Virtual memory objects come in two flavors currently: `WiredVmo` and `PagedVmo`\r\n- `WiredVmo` represents *wired* physical memory and therefore cannot be resized, decomitted, etc. `WiredVmo` is only used for kernel mappings and a very few select user space mappings (such as the WASM VMContext).\r\n- `PagedVmo` is the more complex and sophisticated variant, it represents physical memory that is backed by a pager and which can be paged in and out of memory as necessary. (pagers are not yet implemented but will enable things like disk swap). They also serve as the basis for copy-on-write memory. Internally they use a `FrameList` to determine which frames are resident in memory and which are aliased to one another.\r\n- `ZERO_FRAME` is a global `PagedVmo` that gets allocated at startup and is used whenever zero initialized memory is requested. In the absence of pager backed VMOs the only way to create a Vmo is by cloning it. ",

For this reason `MmapSlice` doesn't expose a real constructor, instead `InstanceAllocator` should allocate the `AddressSpaceRegion` in the `AddressSpace` and then construct a `MmapSlice` using `MmapSlice::from_raw`.",

These platforms have been added to [tier 3] status and use\n    Pulley as their execution backend.\n    [#&#8203;10025](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10025)\n\n-   Initial experimental support for WASIp3 and async features of the Component\n    Model have started to land. These features are not yet ready for\n    general-purpose use.\n    [#&#8203;10044](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10044)\n    [#&#8203;10047](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10047)\n    [#&#8203;10083](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10083)\n    [#&#8203;10103](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10103)\n\n-   The `wasmtime` CLI now supports using a TOML configuration file via `--config`\n    in addition to CLI options.\n    [#&#8203;9811](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9811)\n    [#&#8203;10132](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10132)\n\n-   Initial support for a new assembler on x64 has been added.\n    [#&#8203;10110](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10110)\n    [#&#8203;10178](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10178)\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   `wasmtime-wasi` split the `WasiView` trait into `IoView` and `WasiView`, and\n    `wasmtime-wasi-http` re-uses `IoView` in `WasiHttpView`. Details on porting\n    for embedders in PR.\n    [#&#8203;10016](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10016)\n\n-   `wasmtime-wasi` renamed some exported types and traits. Embedders which use\n    `Pollable`, `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Subscribe`, `HostInputStream`,\n    `HostOutputStream`, `PollableFuture`, or `ClosureFuture` from that crate\n    will need to rename those imports to their new names, describe in PR.\n    [#&#8203;10036](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10036)\n\n-   Components using a 64-bit linear memory should never have worked before, but\n    they're now rejected earlier in the validation process.\n    [#&#8203;9952](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9952)\n\n-   Module validation is now deterministic in the face of multiple errors.\n    [#&#8203;9947](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9947)\n\n-   Wasmtime's minimum supported version of Rust is now 1.82.0.\n    [#&#8203;9956](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9956)\n\n-   Cranelift will now deduplicate `trap[n]z` instructions.\n    [#&#8203;10004](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10004)\n\n-   The `--emit-clif` option to `wasmtime compile` now emits post-optimization\n    CLIF.\n    [#&#8203;10011](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10011)\n\n-   The `signals-based-traps` Cargo feature has been removed in favor of\n    auto-detection of available features based on the `#[cfg]` directives\n    available for the target platform.\n    [#&#8203;9941](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9941)\n\n-   The `async_stack_zeroing` configuration knob now covers all stack allocations,\n    not just those from the pooling allocator.\n    [#&#8203;10027](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10027)\n\n-   Wasmtime should work-by-default on more platforms, even those where Cranelift\n    has no support for the architecture. This is done by ensuring some\n    architecture and platform-specific bits are removed on unknown platforms (and\n    Pulley is used instead).\n    [#&#8203;10107](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10107)\n\n-   Wasmtime now compiles on platforms missing 64-bit atomics.\n    [#&#8203;10134](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10134)\n\n[tier 1]: https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-tiers.html#tier-1\n\n[tier 2]: https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-tiers.html#tier-2\n\n[tier 3]: https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-tiers.html#tier-3\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed a missing case for `Ref::matches_ty` should return `true`.\n    [#&#8203;9985](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9985)\n\n-   A bug with using the `single_pass` register allocation algorithm on x64/s390x\n    has been fixed by refactoring how branches are represented.\n    [#&#8203;10086](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10086)\n    [#&#8203;10087](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10087)\n\n-   A bug with argument extensions on riscv64 has been fixed.\n    [#&#8203;10069](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10069)\n\n-   The `PartialEq` implementation for `RegisteredType` has been fixed.\n    [#&#8203;10091](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10091)\n\n-   The output of `component::bindgen!` now works with `#![no_std]` crates.\n    [#&#8203;10105](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10105)\n\n-   Fix `wasmtime wast` when combined with `--fuel`.\n    [#&#8203;10121](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10121)\n\n-   The `wat` feature of the C API is now plumbed correctly in a few more\n    locations.\n    [#&#8203;10124](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10124)\n\n-   Spurious wake-ups in `blocking_*` methods of `InputStream` and `OutputStream`\n    have been fixed.\n    [#&#8203;10113](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10113)\n\n### [`v29.0.1`](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v29.0.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/compare/v29.0.0...v29.0.1)\n\n#### 29.0.1\n\nReleased 2025-01-21.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fix a missing increment in WASIp1-to-WASIp2 adapter which affected WASI\n    configurations that have multiple preopened directories.\n    [#&#8203;10064](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10064)\n\n### [`v29.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v29.0.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/compare/v28.0.1...v29.0.0)\n\n#### 29.0.0\n\nReleased 2025-01-20.\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Winch now supports epoch-based interruption.\n    [#&#8203;9737](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9737)\n\n-   Pulley, Wasmtime's WebAssembly interpreter, has seen quite a lot of progress\n    and support fleshed out.

    "body": "This PR makes the stack walking implementation of `unwind2` more resilient and useful outside of panics. The big fix here is that apparently leaf functions **do not** spill their return address to the stack instead keeping it in register and EH_FRAME has no explicit instructions on how to recover that. At least according to LLVMs libunwind\r\nhttps://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/6de5d1e46d1812de2bbbbe8d8d2c811e4d16acbe/libunwind/src/DwarfInstructions.hpp#L295-L296\r\nKind of annoyed that this was so obscure and difficult to find :/\r\n\r\nIn the way we previously used stack walking this was fine since `save_context` always explicitly pushed the return address onto the stack:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JonasKruckenberg/k23/blob/4c7edf0e05bae5f979c947224c470d66a120ac8d/libs/unwind2/src/arch/riscv64.rs#L216-L219\r\n\r\nIn essence when called through `begin_unwind` there never was a leaf function that would show this behavior.\r\n\r\nBut now with this fixed we can finally construct stack traces from inside the kernels teap handler too! (In the trap handler we don't control where the return address lives, so need to deal with it potentially not being on stack at all).\r\n",

It completely removes the old `catch_traps` functionality in favor of unwinding the trapped stack similar to a panic (only if the VM page fault handler couldn't correct the trap first of course).\r\nThis has two benefits:\r\n- We can print stack traces for traps which tremendously help with debugging.\r\n- We can use the regular `panic` infrastructure for dealing with traps. In particular, this means that `catch_unwind` will also catch unhandled traps AND that traps inside tasks will be handled just like regular panics. This makes the kernel simpler and helps with stability.",

As a result, a malformed ELF file could trigger out-of-bounds reads in a consumer of the HashTable API by setting these fields to inappropriately large values that would fall outside the relevant hash table section, and by introducing correspondingly out-of-bounds hash table indexes elsewhere in the ELF file.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>nrc/xmas-elf (xmas-elf)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.10.0`](https://redirect.github.com/nrc/xmas-elf/compare/0.9.1...0.10.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nrc/xmas-elf/compare/0.9.1...0.10.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Wasmtime does not yet implement this proposal yet.\n    [#&#8203;10510](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10510)\n    [#&#8203;10557](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10557)\n    [#&#8203;10593](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10593)\n\n-   Cranelift can now optimize some simple possibly-side-effectful instructions,\n    such as division.\n    [#&#8203;10524](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10524)\n\n-   Wasmtime now supports `--invoke` for components using the WAVE format.\n    [#&#8203;10054](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10054)\n\n-   Initial support for the Component Model has landed in Wasmtime's C API. Note\n    that the API is not yet feature-complete, however.\n    [#&#8203;10566](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10566)\n    [#&#8203;10598](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10598)\n    [#&#8203;10651](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10651)\n    [#&#8203;10675](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10675)\n\n-   Wasmtime's C++ API is now available from this repository and the\n    bytecodealliance/wasmtime-cpp repository has been archived. Additionally the\n    monolithic `wasmtime.hh` header file has been split into separate header\n    files.\n    [#&#8203;10582](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10582)\n    [#&#8203;10600](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10600)\n\n-   Wasmtime's cookbook-style documentation has been expanded.\n    [#&#8203;10630](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10630)\n\n-   Wasmtime's now supports custom yield behavior when using epoch interrupts.\n    [#&#8203;10671](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10671)\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   Wasmtime's bindgen now type-checks export functions in the constructor of\n    the generated `{Worldname}Pre` or `{Worldname}` structs, rather than at the\n    call of the export function.\n    [#&#8203;10610](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10610)\n\n-   Wasmtime's `component::Component` and `component::Instance` now have consistient\n    `get_export` and `get_export_index` methods, which return `(ComponentItem,\n    ComponentExportIndex)` and `ComponentExportIndex`, respectively.\n    [#&#8203;10597](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10597)\n\n-   On failure, `wasmtime serve` gives an internal server error response, rather\n    than closing the connection.\n    [#&#8203;10645](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10645)\n\n-   Cranelift's single-pass allocator has been disabled due to being unable to\n    support internal refactorings in preparation for the WebAssembly exceptions\n    proposal. Re-enabling this allocator is tracked at\n    [regalloc2#217](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/regalloc2/issues/217) for\n    those interested.\n    [#&#8203;10554](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10554)\n\n-   Wasmtime's `{Array,Extern,Struct}Ref` functions will now automatically trigger\n    a GC.\n    [#&#8203;10560](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10560)\n\n-   Wasmtime's GC heaps now use the same translation techniques as linear memories\n    meaning they have far fewer bounds-checks than before.\n    [#&#8203;10503](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10503)\n\n-   Wasmtime's implementation of WASIp2 has moved to `wasmtime_wasi::p2` from the\n    root of the crate.\n    [#&#8203;10073](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10073)\n\n-   Wasmtime will no longer emit calls to Cranelift-defined \"libcalls\" and instead\n    everything goes through Wasmtime's libcall mechanism instead, paving the way\n    for a future change for more efficient stack limit checking in wasm. This can\n    also improve deserialize-from-disk times and improve page cache usage for\n    modules that use libcalls as relocations are no longer necessary.\n    [#&#8203;10657](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10657)\n\n-   Configuration of caching can now be done through an API instead of exclusively\n    through a configuration file. Additionally cache-related APIs in `Config` have\n    changed.\n    [#&#8203;10665](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10665)\n\n-   Resources in the Component Model are now stored in a single table per-instance\n    instead of per-type tables. Guests will see a different pattern of index\n    allocation but this is not expected to cause any issues at runtime.\n    [#&#8203;10701](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10701)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Some math intrinsics have been fixed when compiled by Rust 1.87+.\n    [#&#8203;10534](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10534)\n\n-   Component model libcalls correctly handle platform-specific argument extension\n    in ABIs.\n    [#&#8203;10540](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10540)\n\n-   An off-by-one issue with DWARF debuginfo has been fixed.\n    [#&#8203;10570](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10570)\n\n-   The `Config::target` method is no longer gated by a `#[cfg]` for an enabled\n    compiler, it can be used when only the `runtime` feature is available.\n    [#&#8203;10618](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10618)\n\n-   An issue with \"simulated\" DWARF has been fixed.\n    [#&#8203;10681](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10681)\n\n-   C/C++ headers are now tested that they can be included in isolation, and a\n    number of issues have been fixed.\n    [#&#8203;10694](https://redirect.github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10694)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

    "title": "fix: stable task waker identity",
    "body": "The `Waker::will_wake` method which is used to optimize waker code across the async executor only performs \"shallow\" pointer equality checking. This is why usually the waker vtable is stored in a `static`, however I dislike that. IMO the current approach is much cleaner since it correctly inherits the outer generic. The downside of that is we need to use `const` instead of `static` wich would aggressively inline the VTable at callsites. This causes the waker identity to change when calling `.clone()` since the `clone` transitively creates a new reference to the const (and therefore `Waker::will_wake` returns `false` even though it is the functionally the same waker). This *doesn't* affect correctness, it just degrades performance. Using this load-bearing `inline(never)` on the only function that references `Self::WAKER_VTABLE` fixes the inlining issue and preserves a stable identity for the waker.",

Let me know what I can help with to make this possible!\r\n\r\nJust one comment about AI (bc we don't have an AI policy statement just yet): TLDR; You're reponsible for the code you commit regardless of tooling choice. I personally have mixed feelings about AI but have no problem with you using it (in fact if we want to get a real OS going we'll need all the help we can get). This was probably obvious to you already, just a heads up :)\r\n\r\n",

It is now the responsibility of the caller to bring their own `block_on` implementation that can poll this future.\r\n\r\nThis allows use a different `block_on` impl for tests vs in the kernel. \r\n\r\nThe second major change is fully moving the responsibility of driving the timer to the consumer too. Previously `Timer` was field on the `Executor`, but consumers are fully free to handle the timer however works best for them. In tests we use a separate \"reactor thread\" while in the kernel we rely on timer interrupts like previously.",

          "body": "Question: what's the exact issue you're seeing on x86_64 without this change? Because theoretically this should already work as expected. \r\n\r\nThe page allocator currently divides the upper half of virtual memory into `arch::PAGE_TABLE_ENTRIES / 2` (so 256 for both RISCV Sv39 and 512 for x86_64 PML4) number of chunks. The idea is that each of those chunks represents a top-level page (so 1GiB on RISCV and 512GB on x86). When allocating a `Layout`, we first pick a contiguous set of top-level pages to fit the layout (most likely just one) and then pick a random offset according to the `Layout` within that top level page.\r\n\r\nYour current change maintains correct behavior on 3-level MMUs, would break on 2-or-less-level MMUs, but more importantly would only utilize the *lower half* of the kernel space on 4-level MMUs. This obviously isn't great from an ASLR entropy perspective, but also means during kernel allocation we essentially waste half the available virtual memory.\r\n\r\nSo my question: What's the error you're seeing? Can this be solved differently somehow (again, I *think* this should work already?) otherwise we might have to redo the allocator entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
