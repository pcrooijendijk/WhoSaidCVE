- Fixes CVE GHSA-v6h2-p8h4-qcjw (brace-expansion ReDoS vulnerability)
- The vulnerable brace-expansion@1.1.11 is vendored inside protobufjs's CLI dependencies
- Applied manual replacement during build to update to brace-expansion@1.1.12

## Details
The vulnerability exists in a vendored dependency chain:
```
kubeflow-centraldashboard
└── @google-cloud/monitoring@1.2.0
    └── google-gax@1.3.0
        └── protobufjs@6.11.2
            └── cli/node_modules/ (vendored)
                └── espree@7.3.1
                    └── glob@7.2.3
                        └── minimatch@3.1.2
                            └── brace-expansion@1.1.11 (vulnerable)
```

Since protobufjs 6.x vendors its CLI dependencies, npm overrides don't work. The fix manually replaces the vendored brace-expansion during the build process.

## Test plan
- [x] Built package successfully
- [x] Tests pass
- [x] Scanned with wolfictl - CVE is no longer present
- [x] Only two unrelated CVEs remain (taffydb and request)

pull_request,body,597,['CVE-2024-8612'],[],[],[],"This PR adds a patch for CVE-2024-8612 to the qemu package. 

## Issue Description

CVE-2024-8612 addresses a vulnerability in QEMU's bounce buffer implementation. When DMA memory cannot be directly accessed, QEMU previously provided only a single bounce buffer per AddressSpace and would fail DMA map requests while the buffer was already in use, causing DMA failures that resulted in hardware errors from the guest perspective.

## Changes Made

- Added the upstream patch from [QEMU project](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/637b0aa139565cb82a7b9269e62214f87082635c) which allocates DMA bounce buffers dynamically
- Incremented package release from 16 to 17
- Added appropriate changelog entry

## Fix Summary

The patch:
1. Allocates DMA bounce buffers dynamically instead of using a single buffer
2. Limits the total bounce buffer allocation size for each AddressSpace 
3. Adds a new x-max-bounce-buffer-size parameter for PCI devices
4. Properly handles multiple simultaneous DMA mapping requests

This change ensures that multiple DMA mappings can work correctly when RAM can't be mmap()-ed, preventing guest-visible hardware errors.

pull_request,body,667,"['CVE-2024-45337', 'CVE-2021-21300']",[],[],[],"## Overview

This PR addresses critical security vulnerabilities identified in the `release/v1.5` branch by updating dependencies in both main `go.mod` and `build/tools/go.mod` files. The analysis revealed that while the master branch had recent security updates, the release/v1.5 branch was missing critical patches.

## Security Updates Applied

### Main go.mod
- **github.com/Microsoft/hcsshim**: v0.12.0 → v0.13.0
- **github.com/Microsoft/go-winio**: v0.4.17 (forced downgrade) → v0.6.2

### Build Tools go.mod  
- **golang.org/x/crypto**: v0.23.0 → v0.30.0
- **golang.org/x/net**: v0.25.0 → v0.32.0
- **golang.org/x/sys**: v0.20.0 → v0.28.0  
- **google.golang.org/protobuf**: v1.34.2 → v1.36.6
- **github.com/golangci/golangci-lint**: v1.59.0 → v1.63.4
- **sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools**: v0.13.0 → v0.16.3

## CVEs Resolved

### High Severity
1. **CVE-2021-21300** - github.com/Microsoft/go-winio privilege escalation vulnerability
2. **CVE-2024-45337** - golang.org/x/crypto cryptographic issues

### Medium Severity  
3. **HTTP/2 vulnerabilities** in golang.org/x/net
4. **gRPC security issues** in versions below 1.66.x
5. **Protocol buffer parsing vulnerabilities** in google.golang.org/protobuf

### Low Severity
6. **Container runtime security fixes** in Microsoft/hcsshim

## Critical Fix Highlight

The most significant security improvement is updating `go-winio` from v0.4.17 to v0.6.2. The release/v1.5 branch had a forced replacement pinning this package to an old, vulnerable version that contained CVE-2021-21300 - a privilege escalation vulnerability.

## Testing

- ✅ All modules build successfully: `go build ./...`
- ✅ Tools compilation verified: `golangci-lint` builds without issues  
- ✅ No breaking changes detected
- ✅ All dependencies resolved without conflicts

## Branch Impact

- **Master branch**: Already contains most recent secure versions ✅
- **Release/v1.5 branch**: Now updated with critical security patches ✅

Changes are applied to the `security-updates-release-v1.5` branch based on `release/v1.5`.

Fixes #3718.

pull_request,body,1743,['CVE-2025-48387'],[],[],[],"## Summary

This PR addresses a security vulnerability (CVE-2025-48387) by upgrading the `tar-fs` package from version 3.0.8 to 3.0.9 across the entire dependency tree.

## Problem

The repository had multiple versions of `tar-fs` installed:
- `tar-fs@^3.0.6` (resolving to 3.0.9) - used by newer dependencies like `@puppeteer/browsers`
- `tar-fs@^2.0.0` (resolving to 2.1.3) - used by older dependencies like `puppeteer-core@5.5.0`

The older version (2.1.3) contained the security vulnerability that needed to be addressed.

## Solution

Added a yarn resolution to force all instances of `tar-fs` to use version `^3.0.9`:

```json
{
  ""resolutions"": {
    ""tar-fs"": ""^3.0.9""
  },
  ""resolutions.justification"": {
    ""tar-fs"": ""CVE-2025-48387 - Security vulnerability fix by upgrading tar-fs from 3.0.8 to 3.0.9""
  }
}
```

## Results

- All `tar-fs` instances now resolve to version **3.1.0** (even newer than the target 3.0.9)
- The vulnerable version 2.1.3 has been completely removed from the dependency tree
- Security vulnerability CVE-2025-48387 is now resolved
- No functional changes to the codebase - purely a security upgrade

## Testing

- ✅ `yarn install` completes successfully
- ✅ `yarn build` passes without errors
- ✅ Verified all tar-fs instances use version 3.1.0
- ✅ Confirmed removal of the vulnerable version

Fixes #14851.

## Security Issues Fixed

### CVE-2025-24970 - io.netty:netty-handler:4.1.91.Final
- **Issue**: Vulnerable netty-handler version was inherited from Spring Boot BOM
- **Fix**: Upgraded to netty-handler:4.1.113.Final via dependency management override
- **Impact**: Affects all modules using Netty (web components, reactive features)

### CVE-2023-44981 - org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper:3.6.0  
- **Issue**: Vulnerable zookeeper version was inherited from spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery
- **Fix**: Upgraded to zookeeper:3.8.4 via dependency management override
- **Impact**: Affects apollo-biz module and its dependents (apollo-configservice, apollo-adminservice)

## Changes Made

Added explicit dependency management overrides in the root `pom.xml`:

```xml
<!-- to fix CVE-2025-24970 -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
    <artifactId>netty-bom</artifactId>
    <version>4.1.113.Final</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
    <artifactId>netty-handler</artifactId>
    <version>4.1.113.Final</version>
</dependency>
<!-- to fix CVE-2023-44981 -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.zookeeper</groupId>
    <artifactId>zookeeper</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.4</version>
</dependency>
```

## Compatibility

These upgrades maintain full compatibility with:
- Spring Boot 2.7.11
- Spring Cloud 2021.0.5  
- Java 8+ requirements
- Existing Apollo functionality

## Verification

The dependency management overrides ensure that all affected modules will use the secure versions, eliminating the reported vulnerabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

pull_request,body,2776,[],[],[],['GHSA-35JH-R3H4-6JHM'],"This PR fixes the security vulnerability in the unmaintained `lodash.template` dependency by migrating to the maintained `lodash` package.

## Problem
The project was using `lodash.template@4.5.0` which has a known vulnerability (GHSA-35jh-r3h4-6jhm) and is no longer maintained. The vulnerability was identified in the dependency tree:

```
└─┬ license-checker-webpack-plugin@0.2.1
  └── lodash.template@4.5.0
```

## Solution
Replaced the unmaintained `lodash.template` package with the full `lodash` package which includes the same template functionality but is actively maintained and secure.

## Changes Made
- **package.json**: Replaced `""lodash.template"": ""^4.5.0""` with `""lodash"": ""^4.17.21""`
- **src/licenseUtils.js**: Updated import from `const template = require(""lodash.template"")` to `const { template } = require(""lodash"")`
- **README.md**: Updated example code to show the new import syntax

## Testing
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Template functionality verified to work identically with the new dependency
- Vulnerability count reduced from 61 to 59 in npm audit
- The specific lodash.template vulnerability no longer appears in security scans

## Backward Compatibility
This change maintains full backward compatibility as the `lodash.template` function in the full lodash package has identical functionality to the standalone package.

Fixes #65.

This PR updates several dependencies to resolve security vulnerabilities identified by npm audit:

### Security vulnerabilities fixed:

1. **nanoid < 3.3.8** (Moderate) - Updated from ^3.1.31 to ^3.3.8
   - Fixed predictable results in nanoid generation when given non-integer values
   - [CVE Details](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mwcw-c2x4-8c55)

2. **puppeteer-core** (High) - Updated from ^22.12.1 to ^22.14.0
   - Resolved tar-fs vulnerability related to path traversal via crafted tar files
   - [CVE Details](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pq67-2wwv-3xjx)

3. **release-it** (Moderate) - Updated from ^16.2.1 to ^19.0.2
   - Fixed multiple ReDoS vulnerabilities in @octokit packages
   - [CVE Details](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xx4v-prfh-6cgc)

4. **@fluidframework dependencies** - Pinned to exact versions (2.31.1)
   - Prevents incompatible updates that could cause TypeScript compilation issues

### Verification:
- ✅ All unit tests pass with these dependency updates
- ✅ Compatibility with existing code maintained

### Remaining vulnerabilities:

There are moderate severity ReDoS vulnerabilities in @octokit/* dependencies used by @microsoft/generator-powerpages. These can't be fixed without downgrading @microsoft/generator-powerpages from 1.21.19 to 1.21.16, which could potentially introduce breaking changes.

### Notes:
The build system shows some webpack compilation errors related to missing buildRegionConfiguration and TypeScript errors in @fluidframework, but these appear to be pre-existing issues not directly related to these dependency updates.

pull_request,body,2889,['CVE-2024-45337'],[],[],[],"This PR updates `golang.org/x/crypto` from v0.24.0 to v0.31.0 to address CVE-2024-45337. While the vulnerability specifically affects the SSH module in x/crypto (which this project doesn't use), updating to a newer version helps satisfy security scanners and keeps dependencies current.

## Changes Made

- Updated `golang.org/x/crypto` from v0.24.0 to v0.31.0
- Updated transitive dependencies:
  - `golang.org/x/sys` from v0.21.0 to v0.28.0  
  - `golang.org/x/text` from v0.16.0 to v0.21.0

## Impact Assessment

This project only uses two packages from golang.org/x/crypto:
- `golang.org/x/crypto/md4` in the NTLM authentication module
- `golang.org/x/crypto/pkcs12` in the local certificate key provider

Neither of these packages are related to SSH functionality, so the CVE does not affect this codebase. The update is purely to address security scanner warnings.

## Testing

- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ All crypto-related tests pass (NTLM, localcert, always-encrypted)
- ✅ No breaking changes detected

Fixes #265.

pull_request,body,4078,[],['CWE-382'],[],[],"This PR addresses a security vulnerability identified during a security review where the use of `System.exit(10)` in `ExceptionHandler.java` was flagged as inappropriate coding practice according to [CWE-382: J2EE Bad Practices: Use of System.exit()](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/382.html).

## Changes Made

- **Removed `System.exit(10)` call** from the `killProcessAndExit()` method to eliminate the security vulnerability
- **Added proper interrupt handling** by calling `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()` to restore the interrupted status when a thread is interrupted during sleep
- **Added documentation comment** to clarify the graceful exit approach

## Before
```java
private void killProcessAndExit() {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(SLEEP_TIMEOUT_MS);
    } catch (InterruptedException e1) {
        e1.printStackTrace();
    }
    android.os.Process.killProcess(android.os.Process.myPid());
    System.exit(10);  // ❌ Security vulnerability
}
```

## After
```java
private void killProcessAndExit() {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(SLEEP_TIMEOUT_MS);
    } catch (InterruptedException e1) {
        e1.printStackTrace();
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // ✅ Restore interrupted status
    }
    // Finish all activities and exit the application gracefully
    android.os.Process.killProcess(android.os.Process.myPid());
}
```

## Impact

- **Security**: Eliminates CWE-382 violation by removing inappropriate `System.exit()` usage
- **Functionality**: No behavioral change since `android.os.Process.killProcess()` already terminates the process effectively
- **Best Practices**: Follows Java threading best practices by properly handling thread interruption
- **Android Compliance**: Uses Android-appropriate process termination methods

The `System.exit(10)` call was redundant since `android.os.Process.killProcess(android.os.Process.myPid())` already terminates the process. Removing it addresses the security concern without any functional impact.

Fixes #856.

This PR addresses CVE-2025-22872 in the docker-buildx package by applying the upstream patch from the Go library.

## Changes
- Added upstream patch from Golang's net package that fixes improper handling of trailing solidus in unquoted attribute values in foreign content
- Incremented the Release tag from 5 to 6
- Added appropriate changelog entry

## Technical Details
The vulnerability occurs in the HTML tokenizer when parsing tags with trailing solidus in unquoted attribute values. The parser correctly handles tags like `<p a=/>` as `<p a=""/"">`, but the tokenizer was emitting the `SelfClosingTagToken` token incorrectly. When used to parse foreign content, this resulted in an incorrect DOM.

The upstream fix improves the logic for detecting self-closing tags by checking that the last character of the tag isn't also the last character of an unquoted attribute value.

## Summary
Upgrades the multer dependency in the enterprise translation package from `^2.0.0` to exactly `2.0.1` to fix a critical DoS vulnerability (CVE-2025-48997).

## Changes
- Updated `multer` dependency from `^2.0.0` to `2.0.1` in `enterprise/packages/translation/package.json`
- Updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` to reflect the new dependency version

## Security Impact
The vulnerability (CVE-2025-48997) affects multer versions `>=1.4.4-lts.1, <2.0.1` and allows attackers to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending upload file requests with empty string field names, causing unhandled exceptions that crash the process.

## Testing
- ✅ Verified multer version upgraded to 2.0.1 using `pnpm list multer`
- ✅ Lint checks pass for the enterprise translation package
- ✅ No breaking changes according to multer 2.0.1 release notes (security-only release)

## Summary
Upgrades the vulnerable multer dependency from version ^1.4.5-lts.1 to ^2.0.0 in the enterprise translation package to fix critical DoS vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Details
- **CVE-2025-47935** and **CVE-2025-47944**: Multer versions >=1.4.4-lts.1 allow attackers to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending malformed multi-part upload requests, causing unhandled exceptions that crash the process.
- **Impact**: Process crashes when handling malformed file uploads in the translation service
- **Fix**: Upgrade to multer 2.0.0 which includes improved busboy error handling

## Changes Made
- Updated `multer` from `^1.4.5-lts.1` to `^2.0.0` in `enterprise/packages/translation/package.json`
- Updated `@types/multer` from `^1.4.10` to `^1.4.12` for compatibility
- Updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` to reflect dependency changes

## Testing
- Verified multer is only used in the enterprise translation package
- Confirmed no breaking API changes between versions
- File upload functionality in translation service remains compatible:
  - JSON file validation still works
  - 50KB file size limit enforcement unchanged
  - Multipart form handling unchanged

## Summary
This PR resolves Dependabot security alert #86 by updating the vulnerable `shescape` dependency from version 1.7.4 to 2.1.4, addressing CVE-2025-30222.

## Vulnerability Details
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-30222
- **Package**: shescape
- **Vulnerable versions**: >= 1.7.2, < 2.1.2
- **Severity**: Low
- **Impact**: Potential environment variable exposure on Windows with CMD shell

The vulnerability affects users of Shescape on Windows that explicitly configure `shell: 'cmd.exe'` or `shell: true`, potentially allowing attackers to gain read-only access to environment variables.

## Changes Made
1. **Added shescape override** to root `package.json` to force version `^2.1.4`
2. **Ran `npm audit fix`** to automatically resolve the dependency conflict
3. **Verified the fix** by confirming:
   - `npm ls shescape` shows shescape@2.1.4 is now being used
   - `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities
   - Lint checks pass without errors

## Testing
- ✅ `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities (previously reported shescape vulnerability)
- ✅ `npm ls shescape` confirms shescape@2.1.4 is being used by snyk-docker-plugin
- ✅ `npm run lint` passes with no new errors introduced
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Impact
- **Security**: Resolves CVE-2025-30222 vulnerability
- **Compatibility**: No breaking changes - shescape 2.1.4 is backward compatible
- **Dependencies**: Only affects the transitive dependency chain through snyk-docker-plugin in docker-source

GoFiber’s client uses math/rand for multipart boundaries, similar to the Node.js form-data CVE-2025-7783, making it potentially predictable. Exploitation needs attacker-controlled input and math/rand output observation (e.g., logs, webhooks), which is harder than Node.js due to server-side context. PR to switch to crypto/rand was closed for performance (~10ns to ~300ns) and concerns were dismissed by me at the time. Looking deeper: Risk is low but non-zero; consider crypto/rand and merge.",3105490792.0,,https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/3508,3127629424.0

`147-155`: **Tooltip positioning needs viewport awareness**

The tooltip still uses absolute positioning without viewport boundary checking, which can cause overflow at screen edges.



Consider using a positioning library like Floating UI or implement viewport-aware positioning:
```diff

`55-66`: **Document why position classes are empty**

The position classes are all empty strings, with a comment indicating they're handled by ToastContainer. Consider adding a more detailed comment explaining this design decision or removing the unused position prop if it's not needed.

```diff
-  // Position classes are intentionally left empty because all positioning styles
-  // are applied by the ToastContainer component, which handles the absolute positioning,
-  // z-index stacking, and responsive placement of all toast notifications.
-  // Individual toasts only handle their own content styling and animations.
+  // Position classes are intentionally empty as positioning is handled by the parent ToastContainer component
+  // The position prop is passed through for the container to read but not used for styling here
   const positionClasses: Record<ToastPosition, string> = {

`88-112`: **Remove unnecessary function wrappers from derived values**

<summary>🔇 Additional comments (89)</summary><blockquote>

<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/forms/SelectDropdown.types.ts (1)</summary>

`1-14`: **Excellent interface design with comprehensive documentation.**

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/data/StatusBadges.svelte (1)</summary>

`39-55`: **Well-implemented mapping pattern addresses previous feedback.**

The component successfully refactors the previous switch statements into mapping objects (`statusBadgeClassMap` and `statusTextMap`) with appropriate fallback handling. This improves maintainability and reduces code duplication as suggested in the previous review.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/ui/Card.test.ts (1)</summary>

`6-10`: **Good implementation of helper function pattern.**

The helper function successfully addresses the previous review feedback about reducing repetitive TypeScript casting patterns. This improves maintainability across the test suite.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/data/ConfidenceCircle.svelte (1)</summary>

`28-43`: **Input validation implementation looks good**

The enhanced input validation properly handles edge cases and different confidence formats. This addresses the previous concern about missing validation.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/data/WeatherIcon.svelte (2)</summary>

`59-68`: **Improved weather code extraction logic**

The regex-based weather code extraction with proper validation is a significant improvement. It safely handles various input formats and prevents errors from malformed weather icon strings.

---

`77-83`: **Size implementation is well done**

Unlike some other components, this properly implements the size prop with appropriate CSS classes for different text sizes.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/data/WeatherInfo.test.svelte (2)</summary>

`4-32`: **Type safety improvements implemented**

The WeatherData interface is now properly defined with specific types instead of using `any`. This addresses the previous concern about type safety and provides better IntelliSense support.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/forms/SelectField.svelte (2)</summary>

`80-94`: **Accessibility improvements with SVG icon**

The Unicode help icon has been replaced with a proper SVG icon, which provides better accessibility and consistent rendering across browsers and screen readers.

---

`128-135`: **Improved tooltip positioning strategy**

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/ui/EmptyState.svelte (1)</summary>

`39-39`: **Approve static SVG mappings**

All `dataIcons` entries are defined as a constant in frontend/src/lib/utils/icons.ts (lines 301–323) with hardcoded SVG strings and cannot be modified at runtime. Using `{@html dataIcons.inbox}` here poses no XSS risk.

- Verified `export const dataIcons = { … inbox: \`<svg …>\` … }` is static and not derived from user input.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/data/DataTable.test.ts (1)</summary>

`234-234`: **SVG testing approach improved**

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/ui/NotificationToast.test.ts (2)</summary>

`11-18`: **Excellent timer management setup.**

The use of `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks with `vi.useFakeTimers()` and proper cleanup ensures reliable testing of time-based functionality without race conditions.

---

`242-257`: **Thorough lifecycle testing.**

The cleanup testing on unmount ensures proper resource management and prevents memory leaks. The test structure effectively verifies that no errors occur after unmounting, which is crucial for component reliability.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/ui/ErrorAlert.svelte (2)</summary>

`1-48`: **Excellent implementation addressing previous feedback.**

Great work addressing the previous review comments! The component now:

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/forms/NumberField.svelte (2)</summary>

`36-71`: **Excellent improvement to input validation.**

Great work addressing the previous feedback! The `handleChange` function now implements robust validation:
- Properly handles different input types (arrays, booleans, strings, numbers)
- Uses `isFinite()` check to ensure valid numbers
- Enforces min/max constraints appropriately
- Prevents invalid values from updating state

This is a significant improvement in robustness and user experience.

---

`77-80`: **Improved name generation addressing previous feedback.**

Excellent improvement to the name generation logic! The chained regex operations now properly:
- Convert to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens  
- Remove special characters to ensure valid HTML name attributes

This addresses the previous review comment and makes the component more robust.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/forms/DateRangePicker.test.ts (1)</summary>

`6-10`: **Excellent test helper addressing previous feedback.**

Great improvement! The `renderDateRangePicker` helper function successfully addresses the previous review comment by centralizing the TypeScript casting and reducing repetition throughout the test suite.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/forms/ToggleField.svelte (3)</summary>

`5-6`: **Excellent ID generation improvement.**

Great work addressing the previous feedback! The counter-based approach (`toggleFieldCounter`) is much more reliable than `Math.random()` and eliminates the possibility of ID collisions in large applications.




Also applies to: 32-32

---

`34-39`: **Simplified state management addressing previous feedback.**

Perfect improvement! The `handleChange` function now only calls `onUpdate()` and lets the bindable value handle internal state automatically. This eliminates the potential conflicts with reactive state management that were mentioned in the previous review.

---

`42-85`: **Well-structured template with excellent accessibility.**

The template implementation demonstrates good practices:
- Proper label association with `for={fieldId}`
- Conditional ARIA attributes linking to error or description
- Clean styling with conditional CSS classes
- Good responsive layout with flexbox

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/ui/MultiStageOperation.test.ts (1)</summary>

`6-221`: **Excellent test coverage and organization.**

The test suite thoroughly covers all component functionality including rendering, state management, variants, error handling, user interactions, and accessibility features. The tests are well-organized and verify both positive and edge case scenarios.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/ui/ActionMenu.svelte (1)</summary>

`1-190`: **Well-implemented accessible dropdown menu component.**

The component demonstrates excellent practices:
- Proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Clean event handling with proper cleanup
- Smart positioning logic that adapts to viewport constraints
- Good TypeScript integration with modern Svelte 5 syntax
- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate roles

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/ui/Input.svelte (2)</summary>

`21-21`: **Good fix for input value type consistency.**

The `value` prop is now correctly typed as `string` only, which matches HTML input element behavior and resolves the previous type inconsistency issue.

---

`5-20`: **Comprehensive input type support added.**

The component now supports a complete set of HTML input types including the previously missing `checkbox`, `radio`, `file`, `search`, `color`, and `range` types, addressing the earlier feedback.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/ui/Pagination.svelte (3)</summary>

`78-107`: **Excellent optimization implementation.**

The code properly addresses the previous performance concern by using `{@const pages = visiblePages()}` to cache the function result and avoid repeated calculations. The variables `firstPage` and `lastPage` further optimize the logic.

---

`28-43`: **Robust visible pages calculation logic.**

The algorithm correctly handles edge cases:
- Centering around current page
- Adjusting start position when near the end
- Ensuring the correct number of visible pages
- Handling boundaries properly

---

`60-124`: **Comprehensive accessibility implementation.**

The component includes proper ARIA attributes:
- `aria-label` for navigation context
- `aria-current=""page""` for current page indication
- `aria-label` for individual page buttons
- Semantic button roles and disabled states

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/lib/desktop/components/forms/ToggleField.test.ts (3)</summary>

`119-144`: **Well-implemented disabled state test.**

The test properly addresses the previous feedback by attempting to interact with the disabled toggle and verifying that the `onUpdate` callback is not called. The try-catch handling for the potentially failing click is a good approach.

---

`298-331`: **Excellent accessibility testing coverage.**

The tests properly verify ARIA attributes including `aria-describedby` for both error and description scenarios, ensuring the component meets accessibility standards.

---

`5-362`: **Comprehensive and well-structured test suite.**

The test suite covers all essential aspects:
- Basic rendering and props
- State management and user interactions  
- Error handling and styling
- Accessibility attributes
- Edge cases and unique ID generation
- HTML attribute forwarding

The tests are well-organized, use appropriate assertions, and follow modern testing practices.

</details>
<details>
<summary>frontend/src/App.svelte (4)</summary>

`1-19`: **Excellent TypeScript implementation for dynamic components!**

The component references are properly typed with `Component | null`, addressing the previous review feedback. Good architectural decision to keep the dashboard as a static import for initial load performance.

---

`31-69`: **Well-structured route configuration!**

The route configuration using the `RouteConfig` interface and the settings subpages mapping provides excellent maintainability. This addresses the previous feedback about improving routing logic.

---

`165-227`: **Comprehensive routing implementation!**

The routing logic properly handles all cases including settings subpages, error pages via query parameters, and unknown routes. The special handling for settings subpages that updates page titles dynamically is particularly well done.

---

`248-254`: **Ignore replacing the function call with `<svelte:component>`**

In Svelte 5 the SSR‐compiled route component is correctly invoked via its `component()` function. The `<svelte:component>` tag is deprecated in v5 and only applies to client‐side dynamic rendering, not the SSR pattern used here. No changes are needed.

<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/misc/ModalScreen.tsx (1)</summary><blockquote>

`100-105`: **Prefer design-system spacing tokens over raw numbers**

Hard-coding `8` bypasses the theme’s spacing scale and risks visual drift if the global scale changes. Tamagui (and our design system) exposes `$space.*` tokens that remain semantically meaningful and automatically adjust across breakpoints.

```diff
-        marginHorizontal={8}
+        // `$2` = 8px on current scale
+        marginHorizontal=""$2""
```

Aligns with the ongoing effort in this PR to make style props explicit and consistent.

<details>
<summary>app/src/types/png.d.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>

`1-4`: **Standard PNG module declaration with room for improvement**

The module declaration follows standard patterns for asset imports. While using `any` is common for image assets, consider using a more specific type for better type safety.




Consider using a more specific type for better type safety:

```diff
 declare module '*.png' {
-  const content: any;
+  const content: string;
   export default content;
 }
```

This assumes PNG imports resolve to URL strings (common in most bundler configurations).

Learning: In app/src/components/native/QRCodeScanner.tsx, the Android camera dimension multipliers (screenWidth * 3 and screenHeight * 2) are intentionally set to these values and should not be changed. These multipliers are correct and any visual issues with black areas in the camera preview are caused by other factors, not the dimension calculations.

<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/misc/LaunchScreen.tsx (1)</summary>

`38-45`: **Explicit `backgroundColor` prop improves readability and avoids shorthand ambiguity—nice touch.**  
This aligns with the new ESLint style rules and keeps the styling intent crystal-clear. No functional impact observed.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/layouts/SimpleScrolledTitleLayout.tsx (3)</summary>

`3-3`: **Good TypeScript modernization!**

Explicitly importing `PropsWithChildren` directly is cleaner than accessing it via the React namespace. This improves code readability and follows modern React TypeScript patterns.

---

`14-14`: **Consistent with import modernization.**

The interface correctly uses the directly imported `PropsWithChildren` type, maintaining the same type safety while being consistent with the updated import statement.

---

`47-47`: **Confirm Tamagui spacing token mapping**

I didn’t find a local definition for the `$2` token in the repo, so it’s likely coming from Tamagui’s default theme. Please double-check that `$2` indeed resolves to `16px`. If it doesn’t, hard-coding `16` here could drift from your design system.

• Affected locations:  
  – `app/src/layouts/SimpleScrolledTitleLayout.tsx` (SecondaryButton `marginBottom={16}`)  
  – `app/src/screens/misc/LaunchScreen.tsx` (`marginBottom: 16`)  
  – `app/src/components/native/PassportCamera.web.tsx` (`marginBottom: '16px'`)

Recommendations:  
- If `$2` equals 16px in your theme, feel free to keep it explicit—but be aware future token changes won’t propagate.  
- Otherwise, revert to token usage (`marginBottom=""$2""`) or define a custom token for 16px spacing to preserve design consistency.

<summary>app/src/screens/passport/PassportNFCScanScreen.web.tsx (1)</summary>

`35-37`: **LGTM! Style prop standardization improves readability.**

The change from shorthand props (`h`, `w`) to full CSS property names (`height`, `width`) enhances code clarity and aligns with the updated ESLint configuration. This standardization makes the codebase more maintainable.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/components/native/RCTFragment.tsx (1)</summary>

`4-9`: **LGTM! Import consolidation enhances code organization.**

Consolidating the React Native imports into a single grouped statement improves readability and aligns with the updated ESLint import sorting rules. The functionality remains unchanged while the code structure is cleaner.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/stores/proofHistoryStore.ts (1)</summary>

`170-170`: **LGTM! Enforcing immutability with const declaration.**

Changing from `let` to `const` for `totalCount` is appropriate since the variable is never reassigned. This enforces immutability and prevents accidental modifications, improving code safety and aligning with TypeScript best practices.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/prove/QRCodeTroubleScreen.tsx (2)</summary>

`3-3`: **LGTM! Explicit hook import follows modern React patterns.**

Explicitly importing `useEffect` and using it directly instead of `React.useEffect` improves code consistency and follows modern React development patterns. This standardization enhances maintainability across the codebase.

---

`48-50`: **LGTM! Consistent hook usage after explicit import.**

The direct `useEffect` call aligns with the explicit import pattern and maintains the same functionality for analytics flushing on error screen mount. The dependency array is correctly empty for one-time execution.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/passport/PassportCameraTroubleScreen.tsx (2)</summary>

`3-3`: **LGTM! Consistent hook import pattern across trouble screens.**

The explicit `useEffect` import maintains consistency with other trouble screen components and follows modern React development practices. This standardization improves codebase maintainability.

---

`51-53`: **LGTM! Proper analytics flushing on error screen mount.**

The direct `useEffect` usage with empty dependency array correctly flushes analytics once when the trouble screen mounts. This pattern is consistent with other error screens in the application.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx (1)</summary>

`3-3`: **LGTM: Clean import modernization**

The update from `React.Component` to named imports aligns with modern React patterns and improves code clarity. The functionality remains unchanged while making dependencies more explicit.

<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/home/ProofHistoryDetailScreen.tsx (1)</summary>

`92-92`: **Excellent dependency array fix**

Adding `data.appName` to the dependency array is crucial since the disclosure strings are templated with the app name. This prevents stale closures and ensures the UI updates correctly when the app name changes.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/recovery/AccountVerifiedSuccessScreen.tsx (1)</summary>

`35-40`: **Good standardization of style props**

Replacing shorthand Tamagui props with full CSS property names improves code readability and maintainability. This makes the styling more explicit and easier to understand for developers familiar with standard CSS.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/home/DisclaimerScreen.tsx (1)</summary>

`38-38`: **Consistent style prop standardization**

Converting shorthand props (`f`, `jc`, `pb`) to full CSS property names (`flex`, `justifyContent`, `paddingBottom`) maintains consistency with the codebase-wide standardization effort and improves code clarity.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/passport/PassportNFCTroubleScreen.tsx (1)</summary>

`3-3`: **Clean React hook import modernization**

Updating from `React.useEffect` to direct `useEffect` import follows modern React patterns and improves code clarity. The change maintains identical functionality while making hook dependencies more explicit.




Also applies to: 50-50

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/components/native/PassportCamera.web.tsx (2)</summary>

`3-3`: **LGTM: Import modernization aligns with React best practices.**

The explicit import of `useEffect` follows modern React patterns and improves code readability. This change is consistent with the broader ESLint configuration updates across the codebase.

---

`30-30`: **Clean conversion from React.useEffect to direct useEffect usage.**

The direct usage of `useEffect` is more concise and aligns with contemporary React development patterns. The hook's functionality and dependencies remain unchanged.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/recovery/PassportDataNotFoundScreen.tsx (3)</summary>

`3-3`: **Good modernization of React import pattern.**

Explicit import of `useEffect` improves code clarity and follows current React best practices.

---

`19-19`: **Clean conversion to direct useEffect usage.**

The direct `useEffect` call is more readable and consistent with modern React development patterns.

---

`29-33`: **Improved prop readability with explicit marginTop.**

Converting from the shorthand `mt={8}` to explicit `marginTop={8}` with multi-line formatting enhances code readability and maintainability. This change aligns with the project-wide effort to standardize prop naming conventions.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/layouts/ExpandableBottomLayout.tsx (1)</summary>

`107-107`: **No remaining `pb` usages found – removal of shorthand fallback is safe**

I ran a project-wide search for any `pb=` attributes (including on ExpandableBottomLayout and BottomSection) in all `.ts`/`.tsx` files under `app/src` and found zero occurrences. You can safely standardize on `paddingBottom` without breaking existing components.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/mocks/react-native-safe-area-context.js (2)</summary>

`3-3`: **Excellent modernization of React imports in mock file.**

Converting to named imports (`createContext`, `createElement`, `Fragment`) from default React import improves consistency with the broader codebase changes and follows modern React patterns.

---

`7-7`: **Clean conversion to direct React API usage.**

The direct usage of `createElement`, `Fragment`, and `createContext` eliminates the need to access these through the React object, making the code more concise and consistent with the project's updated import style.

<details>
<summary>app/src/utils/proving/cose.ts (1)</summary>

`22-22`: **No named `cose` imports detected – removal of named export is safe**

I performed a repo-wide search under `app/src` and found only a default import of `cose` in  
- `app/src/utils/proving/attest.ts:14`  

No instances of `import { cose }` were found. Removing the named export from `cose.ts` won’t break any existing internal usage.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/home/HomeScreen.tsx (3)</summary>

`8-8`: **Good practice: Explicit hook imports improve code clarity**

The change from importing React as a namespace to explicitly importing `useCallback` alongside React improves code readability and makes dependencies more transparent.

---

`56-69`: **Proper useCallback implementation for useFocusEffect optimization**

Wrapping the async function in `useCallback` with correct dependencies (`[getAllDocuments, navigation]`) is essential for preventing unnecessary re-renders and ensuring the effect updates when dependencies change.

---

`78-80`: **Style prop standardization enhances code consistency**

The changes from shorthand props (`bg`, `jc`, `ai`) to full CSS property names (`backgroundColor`, `justifyContent`, `alignItems`) improve code readability and align with explicit styling conventions across the codebase. This standardization reduces ambiguity and makes the code more accessible to developers unfamiliar with Tamagui's shorthand syntax.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/prove/ProofRequestStatusScreen.tsx (1)</summary>

`92-100`: **Essential fix: Complete dependency array prevents stale closures**

The expanded dependency array now correctly includes all variables used within the effect (`appName`, `sessionId`, `errorCode`, `reason`, `updateProofStatus`). This prevents stale closure bugs where the effect might use outdated values and ensures proper re-execution when any of these dependencies change. This is particularly important for the analytics tracking and database updates performed in this effect.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/recovery/RecoverWithPhraseScreen.tsx (2)</summary>

`85-85`: **Correct dependency array ensures callback freshness**

Adding `navigation` and `trackEvent` to the dependency array is essential since both are used within the `restoreAccount` callback. This prevents stale closures and ensures the callback always has access to the current navigation instance and tracking function, which is critical for the account recovery flow.

---

`88-93`: **Style prop standardization maintains consistency**

The conversion from `pb` to `paddingBottom` aligns with the codebase-wide effort to use explicit CSS property names. The reformatted YStack props also improve readability by placing each prop on its own line.

<details>
<summary>app/scripts/mobile-deploy-confirm.cjs (1)</summary>

`282-282`: **Good refactoring: Removed unused parameter improves function clarity**

The removal of the unused `versions` parameter from `displayDeploymentHeader` is a clean refactoring that simplifies the function signature. Since the parameter wasn't used within the function implementation, this change reduces complexity without affecting functionality. The corresponding call site was correctly updated to match the new signature.



Also applies to: 353-353

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/settings/PassportDataInfoScreen.tsx (1)</summary>

`51-51`: **Style standardization improves code readability**

The conversion of shorthand style props (`py`, `f`, `jc`, `px`) to their full CSS property equivalents (`paddingVertical`, `flex`, `justifyContent`, `paddingHorizontal`) enhances code clarity and maintains consistency with the broader codebase refactoring effort. These explicit property names make the styling intentions more transparent and accessible to all developers.



Also applies to: 91-91, 93-93, 97-97

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/src/screens/passport/PassportNFCScanScreen.tsx (3)</summary>

`262-272`: **Dependency array improvements look good!**

The addition of `route.params`, `navigation`, and `openErrorModal` to the dependency array correctly captures all values used within the `onVerifyPress` callback. This ensures the callback stays fresh when these dependencies change.

---

`282-282`: **Appropriate dependency array simplification.**

Since the function body is commented out and only contains empty logic, the empty dependency array is correct.

`101-101`: **Verify use of spacing tokens vs. hardcoded padding**  

Our grep search shows that nearly every component (e.g. ProofHistoryScreen, SettingsScreen, ProofHistoryDetailScreen, Disclosures, Tips, Mnemonic) uses hardcoded paddingVertical values (2, 12, 16, 20, 22, 28) and we found no instances of a theme-based `py=""$n""` token in app/src​.  

Please confirm whether the design system offers spacing tokens for vertical padding. If it does, consider swapping `paddingVertical={16}` (and the other numeric paddingVerticals) for the corresponding token (e.g. `py=""$2""`). Otherwise, keeping the hardcoded value here is consistent with the rest of the codebase.  

• Files using hardcoded paddingVertical:  
  - app/src/screens/home/ProofHistoryScreen.tsx (`paddingVertical={2}`)  
  - app/src/screens/settings/SettingsScreen.tsx (`paddingVertical={20}`)

`6-6`: **Clarify IS_TEST_BUILD conversion without JSON.parse**

The current hook uses `JSON.parse(String(IS_TEST_BUILD ?? 'false'))` to coerce both boolean and string inputs into a boolean. While it “works,” replacing it with `Boolean()` or returning `IS_TEST_BUILD` directly would break the test stub (since `Boolean('false')` yields `true` and a non‐empty string is truthy). Instead, pick one of these cleaner approaches:

• Update the test stub to export a boolean, then simplify the hook:
  File: `app/tests/__setup__/@env.js`
  ```diff
  - export const IS_TEST_BUILD = 'false';
  + export const IS_TEST_BUILD = false;
  ```
  File: `app/src/hooks/useAesopRedesign.ts`
  ```diff
  - return JSON.parse(String(IS_TEST_BUILD ?? 'false'));
  + return IS_TEST_BUILD;
  ```

• Or, handle both types explicitly in the hook without JSON.parse:
  File: `app/src/hooks/useAesopRedesign.ts`
  ```ts
  export function shouldShowAesopRedesign() {
    return typeof IS_TEST_BUILD === 'string'
      ? IS_TEST_BUILD === 'true'
      : IS_TEST_BUILD;
  }
  ```

Either change makes the conversion intention clear, avoids misuse of `JSON.parse`, and keeps tests green.

`34-47`: **Good bias-avoidance implementation, but consider optimizing the reading strategy.**

The bias-avoidance logic correctly computes the rejection threshold. However, the current approach of reading `n` bytes upfront and then re-reading individual bytes could be optimized.



Consider reading bytes one at a time to avoid the overhead of re-reading:

```diff
 func unsafeRandString(n int) (string, error) {
 	L := byte(len(letterBytes))
 	max := byte(256 - (256 % int(L)))
 	out := make([]byte, n)
-	buf := make([]byte, n)
-
-	// Read n raw bytes in one shot
-	if _, err := rand.Read(buf); err != nil {
-		return """", fmt.Errorf(""rand.Read failed: %w"", err)
-	}
 
-	for i, b := range buf {
-		// Reject values ≥ max
-		for b >= max {
-			if _, err := rand.Read(buf[i : i+1]); err != nil {
-				return """", fmt.Errorf(""rand.Read failed: %w"", err)
-			}
-			b = buf[i]
-		}
-		out[i] = letterBytes[b%L]
+	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
+		var b byte
+		for {
+			if _, err := rand.Read([]byte{b}); err != nil {
+				return """", fmt.Errorf(""rand.Read failed: %w"", err)
+			}
+			if b < max {
+				break
+			}
+		}
+		out[i] = letterBytes[b%L]
 	}

Learning: Fiber currently supports square bracket notation in form data with 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' content type, but this feature is not available for multipart form data. The implementation for form-urlencoded is in ctx.go (BodyParser method), while multipart form data handling needs enhancement to support this feature.

`29-29`: **Good character set choice for boundary generation.**

The 62-character set (letters + digits) is well-suited for multipart boundaries and facilitates the bias-avoidance logic in the implementation.

---

`142-147`: **Excellent error handling for the security improvement.**

The error handling correctly propagates failures from the crypto/rand source with appropriate context. This maintains robustness while gaining the security benefits of cryptographic randomness.


Note: As mentioned in the PR objectives, this change increases latency from ~10ns to ~300ns per operation, but provides cryptographically secure boundaries that address potential security concerns similar to CVE-2025-7783.

`50-50`: **LGTM! Webhook trigger appropriately placed.**

The webhook trigger is correctly positioned in the release finalization flow and uses a descriptive event type. The placement after `notify!` and before `RefreshReportsJob` maintains logical sequencing.



Consider whether error handling is needed for the webhook trigger to prevent release finalization failures due to webhook issues, depending on your error handling strategy in the `trigger_webhook!` method.

<summary>spec/models/outgoing_webhook_event_spec.rb (2)</summary><blockquote>

`78-83`: **Consider using a different approach for testing invalid enum values.**

Testing invalid enum values with `build` will raise an `ArgumentError` before Rails validations run. While this correctly verifies that invalid values are rejected, it's testing ActiveRecord's enum behavior rather than your model's validation logic.


Consider adding a model-level validation if you want to provide custom error messages:

```diff
+    it ""is invalid with non-enum status value"" do
+      event = build(:outgoing_webhook_event)
+      event.status = 99 # numeric value outside enum range
+      expect(event).not_to be_valid
+      expect(event.errors[:status]).to include(""is not included in the list"")
+    end
```

---

`109-113`: **Remove duplicate test for release presence.**

This test duplicates the validation test on lines 27-31. The association test on lines 105-107 is sufficient for this section.


```diff
-    it ""requires a release to be present"" do
-      event = build(:outgoing_webhook_event, release: nil)
-      expect(event).not_to be_valid
-      expect(event.errors[:release]).to include(""must exist"")

The method correctly checks for existing integrations and uses fail-fast creation methods.

---

`22-27`: **LGTM! Proper webhook integration deletion logic.**

The method correctly checks for existing integrations and follows the proper sequence of operations (delete app first, then destroy record).

</details>
<details>
<summary>spec/jobs/update_outgoing_webhook_integration_job_spec.rb (1)</summary>

`5-69`: **Excellent test coverage and structure.**

The test suite thoroughly covers all scenarios:
- Creation and deletion flows
- Default parameter behavior  
- Edge cases with missing/unavailable integrations
- Proper use of mocking and instance doubles

The tests are well-organized and follow good RSpec practices.

</details>
<details>
<summary>spec/libs/triggers/outgoing_webhook_spec.rb (1)</summary>

`4-139`: **Outstanding comprehensive test coverage.**

This test suite exemplifies excellent testing practices:
- Complete coverage of all webhook integration states
- Proper mocking of external dependencies
- Integration tests simulating real webhook delivery
- Schema validation testing
- Comprehensive error handling scenarios
- Clear test organization with descriptive contexts

The tests provide confidence in the webhook triggering functionality across all scenarios.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/models/outgoing_webhook_event.rb (3)</summary>

`16-19`: **LGTM! Proper model structure with auditing.**

The model correctly includes paper trail for auditing and has the appropriate association to release.

---

`28-33`: **Validation depends on schema loading fix.**

The `event_type_is_valid` validation correctly checks against valid event types, but it depends on the `VALID_EVENT_TYPES` constant loading successfully. Once the schema loading issue is addressed, this validation will be more robust.

The other validations and scope are well-implemented.

---

`35-49`: **LGTM! Well-designed instance methods.**

The `record_failure!` and `record_success!` methods are well-implemented:
- Clear naming with bang notation for side effects
- Proper use of `update!` for fail-fast behavior
- Clean parameter handling

The private validation method is appropriately scoped and provides clear error messages.

</details>
<details>
<summary>spec/models/svix_integration_spec.rb (6)</summary>

`1-11`: **LGTM! Proper test setup and associations.**

The test setup correctly creates test fixtures and verifies the association between webhook integration and train.

---

`13-31`: **LGTM! Comprehensive validation tests.**

The validation tests properly cover:
- Status presence validation
- App ID uniqueness validation 
- Nullable app ID handling

Good coverage of the model's validation constraints.

---

`33-37`: **LGTM! Enum definition test.**

Correctly verifies the status enum values match expectations.

---

`39-98`: **LGTM! Thorough testing of create_app! method.**

The tests comprehensively cover:
- Successful app creation flow
- Retry logic with proper mocking
- Error handling after max retries
- Proper logging verification

The retry logic test correctly simulates server errors and verifies the retry behavior.

---

`100-138`: **LGTM! Complete delete_app! method testing.**

The tests cover all scenarios:
- Successful app deletion with data cleanup
- Custom app_id parameter handling
- Early return for unavailable integrations

Proper verification of state changes and cleanup behavior.

---

`140-174`: **LGTM! Solid send_message method testing.**

The tests verify:
- Successful message sending with proper JSON parsing
- Error handling with WebhookApiError raising
- Proper mocking of Svix client interactions

Good coverage of both success and failure scenarios.

</details>
<details>
<summary>app/models/train.rb (5)</summary>

`45-45`: **LGTM! Proper schema documentation.**

The new `webhooks_enabled` boolean attribute is correctly documented in the schema comment with appropriate defaults.

---

`90-90`: **LGTM! Proper association definition.**

The `has_one :webhook_integration` association is correctly defined with:
- Proper class name reference to SvixIntegration
- Dependent destroy for cleanup

---

`144-145`: **LGTM! Appropriate callback placement.**

The webhook integration callbacks are properly positioned after other creation callbacks, ensuring proper lifecycle management.

---

`438-438`: **Good fix! Explicit parameter naming.**

The change from implicit `:working_branch` symbol to explicit `working_branch: working_branch` improves clarity and prevents potential issues.

---

`444-446`: **LGTM! Clean helper method.**

The `svix_app_id` helper method provides a clean interface to access the webhook integration's app_id with proper nil handling.

</details>
<details>
<summary>db/schema.rb (5)</summary>

`13-13`: **LGTM!**

Schema version update is appropriate and follows Rails conventions.

---

`481-495`: **Well-designed webhook events table.**

The table structure effectively supports webhook event tracking with:
- Proper foreign key relationships to releases
- Strategic indexing on commonly queried fields (event_timestamp, event_type, status)
- Flexible JSONB storage for event payloads and responses
- Error tracking capabilities for debugging

---

`946-957`: **Solid Svix integration table design.**

The table structure properly manages webhook integrations with:
- One-to-one relationship with trains (unique constraint on train_id)
- Unique constraint on svix_app_id prevents duplicate integrations
- Proper status tracking with sensible default
- Necessary Svix API identifiers for integration management

---

`1014-1014`: **Appropriate feature flag addition.**

The `webhooks_enabled` column is well-designed with:
- Sensible default value (false) for existing records
- Not null constraint ensuring data integrity
- Clear naming following Rails conventions

---

`1145-1145`: **Essential foreign key constraints.**

The foreign key constraints properly ensure referential integrity:
- `outgoing_webhook_events` → `releases` prevents orphaned webhook events
- `svix_integrations` → `trains` ensures integrations are tied to valid trains




Also applies to: 1183-1183

</details>
<details>
<summary>lib/tasks/anonymize.rake (3)</summary>

`53-54`: **Appropriate whitelist addition.**

Adding `webhooks_enabled` to the trains table whitelist is correct as it's a non-sensitive boolean configuration flag, consistent with other feature flags already whitelisted.

---

`61-69`: **Well-designed webhook events anonymization.**

The anonymization logic properly handles webhook event data:
- Preserves non-sensitive operational fields (event_type, status, timestamps)
- Appropriately anonymizes potentially sensitive response data and error messages
- Maintains null values where appropriate
- Follows established anonymization patterns

---

`413-422`: **Appropriate Svix integration anonymization.**

The anonymization logic correctly handles Svix integration data:
- Preserves necessary relational data (train_id) and operational status
- Properly anonymizes Svix-specific identifiers that could be sensitive
- Uses consistent placeholder values maintaining data integrity
- Follows established anonymization patterns

Affected versions of next are vulnerable to Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling'). A vulnerability in Next.js can enable an attacker to poison the cache. Under certain conditions, a HTTP 204 response may be cached for static pages, causing all subsequent requests to receive an empty response and effectively leading to a Denial of Service condition.

A reachable issue is a real security risk because your project actually executes the vulnerable code. This issue is reachable because your code uses a certain version of next.
Affected versions of next are vulnerable to Improper Authorization. Next.js middleware-based authorization checks can be bypassed by an attacker who forges external requests that include a specific header, tricking the application into treating the request as a trusted internal call and thus bypassing access controls.

##### Note: The version is visible when running AzCopy without any argument
10.26.0 (from @azure-tools/azcopy-node 3.4.2)

### Which platform are you using? (ex: Windows, Mac, Linux)
Linux

### What command did you run?
##### Note: Please remove the SAS to avoid exposing your credentials. If you cannot remember the exact command, please retrieve it from the beginning of the log file.
`npm install`

### What problem was encountered?
We have a project that uses @azure-tools/azcopy-node. When running a trivy scan on our project, 3 vulnerabilities are detected related to @azure-tools/azcopy-node on the latest version (3.4.2): CVE-2025-30204, CVE-2024-45337, and CVE-2024-34156.

@azure-tools/azcopy-node is a Node.js library which allows using AzCopy executables in a variety of environments. The current version of @azure-tools/azcopy-node is 3.4.2, which uses AzCopy 10.26.0. The latest version of AzCopy is 10.28.1, which fixes two of the three vulnerabilities listed above, CVE-2025-30204 & CVE-2024-45337. Simply updating @azure-tools/azcopy-node to use AzCopy 10.28.1 will fix these two, but CVE-2024-34156 has not been fixed yet.

### How can we reproduce the problem in the simplest way?
Create a simple project with just the @azure-tools/azcopy-node library in it. Build it with docker, then run a trivy scan on it.

#### package.json
```json
{
  ""name"": ""repo-azcopy-vulnerability"",
  ""version"": ""0.1"",
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""@azure-tools/azcopy-node"": ""3.4.2""
  }
}
```

#### Dockerfile
```
FROM node:22-bookworm as base

RUN apt-get -o ""Acquire::https::Verify-Peer=false"" -y update && \
    apt-get -y upgrade && \
    apt-get -y purge

WORKDIR /app

COPY . ./

RUN npm i

RUN chmod 755 /app/node_modules/@azure-tools/azcopy-linux/dist/bin/azcopy_linux_amd64

USER node
```

#### Run the following command
```
docker build --network host -t repo-azcopy-vulnerability .
```
#### Run a trivy scan on the container with the following command
```
trivy image --ignore-unfixed --severity HIGH,CRITICAL repo-azcopy-vulnerability
```

Observe the output of the trivy scan

### Have you found a mitigation/solution?
No, AzCopy needs to fix vulnerability CVE-2024-34156 and publish an updated version. Then, @azure-tools/azcopy-node needs to publish a release referencing AzCopy's latest version with the vulnerability patch.",2970765358.0,,https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-azcopy/issues/3008,
