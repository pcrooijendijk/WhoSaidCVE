## Repository for the paper: "Who Said CVE? How Vulnerabilities Are Mentioned in Human and Agent Authored Pull Requests"

1. To answer RQ1, we analyse how vulnerability identifiers are mentioned within pull requests using descriptive statistics and additional data collection. We first analyse the identifier mentions extracted from the AIDev-pop dataset, examining which identifier schemes are referenced, how often they appear, and where they occur. We distinguish between the total number of identifier mentions and the number of unique pull requests in which an identifier appears. RQ1 includes two python files: `get_all_ids.py` where the initial search was done on all vulnerability IDs. `get_CVE_CWE.py` is the second and final search where only CVE, CWE, GHSA and GO were taken into account. The results can be found in `RQ1/results` from this search. The `all_ids.json` file contains all unique IDs found while searching the AIDev-pop database.

2. RQ2 includes one python file: `get_other_mentions.py` where the additional search was done on the found IDs in RQ1. The `bots.txt` file are the bot names found by Chidambaram et al. to search for additional agent or bot activity in the pull requests.
